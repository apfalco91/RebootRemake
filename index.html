  <center><h1>Reboots and Remakes Make Money, But At What Cost?</h1></center>
  <center><h3>By Anthony Falco and Josh Futtersak</h3></center>

  <p>Of course, reboots and remakes make money: studios do them to score a quick buck. But is the quick cash really worth devaluing their products? While the answer is far more complicated than one could expect, it would be good to look at both remakes/reboots and how much they make compared to the previous entry in that franchise.<br><br>

  To do this, there must be some ground rules to narrow down the sample size: the newer movies need to make over $25 million and come out in the last 25 years. They also have to both be American made and have gotten a wide release. From our results, there was still a hefty amount of films: 66 to be exact. So we then tried to narrow it down even further by categorizing four separate remakes and reboots by biggest box office gain and loss as well as the highest and lowest Rotten Tomatoes score change. You can see the individual data about the eight films in the below tabs. The overall statistics are featured in the body.</p>

      <center><h3>King Kong Lives Vs. King Kong</h3></center>
      <p><i>King Kong</i> showed what a remake should be. It showed the highest rating change and box office change from any other remake.  The remake used modern technology to rework a classic for a modern audience. <i>King Kong</i> stayed true to the source material and kept the original tone.</p>

    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>101 Dalmations(1961) Vs. 101 Dalmations(1996)</h3></center>
      <p>The live action version of <i>101 Dalmatians</i> was the worst performing remake. The much beloved original had a unique charm that struck a chord with audiences who had not seen a movie like it. The live action remake was a culmination of every late 80&#44;s and 90&#44;s movie. It lacked originality and it suffered because of it.</p>

    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>Ocean's 11(1960) Vs. Ocean's 11(2001)</h3></center>
     <p><i>Ocean's 11</i> is a rare example of a movie that critically did better than its predecessor. It could have just as easily been a repeat of the first movie, but Steven Soderbergh was able to capture everything the audience loved about the original, and take away everything they did not. With the help of an all-star cast, it is the remake that keeps on giving.</p>

    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>The Stepfather(1987) Vs. The Stepfather(2009)</h3></center>
     <p><i>The Stepfather</i> was the remake no one wanted and, as a result, it was the most critically panned remake. Even after bringing in a horror writer and a horror director, the movie was a bust. The cult classic's charm was lost when the writer and director veered away from the source material. Fans of the original were disappointed, and new viewers were just confused.</p>

  <p>Between 2003 and 2012, Hollywood released over 120 remakes. In 2014 half the highest-grossing films were sequels, reboots or remakes. In 2015 the newest sequel Jurassic Park was the highest-grossing film of all time. The average Rotten Tomatoes score for these remakes was 46 percent. The original movies have an average score of 78 percent, yet Hollywood churns out remakes every year. There are many reasons for this, the primary being that there is a built in audience who may be excited to see their favorite movies remade with modern technology. Unfortunately, they often leave disappointed.<br><br>

  Some of the blame for the massive number of sequels, reboots, and remakes can be placed on direct streaming services, and the rise of quality television. No longer can a studio sink $100 million dollars into a film, and assume they will make it back. Hollywood is instead choosing to find films they know will be successful and making franchises out of them, or remaking previously successful movies.</p>

  <p>According to media analysts at Rentrak, in 2014 movie attendance dropped by 5.1 percent, the lowest level since 1995. American moviegoers between the ages of 14-24 dropped by 15 percent after a drop of 17 percent the year before.  Netflix, on the other hand, has been growing steadily, and hit 69 million subscribers in 2015.<br><br>

  Television is working hard to stay relevant, creating a new wave of shows that reinvented the medium. <i>Mad Men</i>, <i>Breaking Bad</i>, and <i>The Walking Dead</i> all are movie quality shows, which are readily available for streaming: simply, you can watch film quality television in the comfort of your home.</p>

  <p>For the most part, remakes are safe. They score low, but they bring in money to an industry that needs it badly.</p>

  </ul>

  <div class="tab-content">
    <div id="menuA" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>Sleeping Beauty Vs. Maleficent</h3></center>
      <p><i>Maleficent</i> had the highest increase in total box office, but this is mainly due to the fact that 1959&#8217;s <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> did not have an international total. In fact, if one was to compare the two domestic receipts, then the reboot made over $170 million less than the original. At the same time, it did not do as well critically as the original, with it scoring 42 points less than <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="menuB" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>Spider-Man Vs. The Amazing Spider-Man</h3></center>
      <p><i>The Amazing Spider-man</i> shares the quickest turnaround award with <i>Halloween</i> and <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>: meaning it took only five short years for there to be a reboot. Still, <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> is unique because it is an origin story only a decade after Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi did the same thing. The numbers show a public that did not really care about this notion, as the international gross made over $235 million less than <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, which is the lowest among reboots.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="menuC" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <center><h3>Batman & Robin Vs. Batman Begins</h3></center>
     <p><i>Batman Begins</i> had the best increase in overall critic score: something that is not hard to do when following <i>Batman & Robin</i>. But it also enjoyed financial success, yet only slightly: it just made over $100 million more than the Joel Schumacher bomb: perhaps people were reluctant to trust Batman right away, as the series did not make big money until <i>The Dark Knight</i>.</p>

    <div id="menuD" class="tab-pane fade in active">
    <center><h3>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer Vs. Fantastic Four(2015)</h3></center>
     <p>Fantastic Four is probably the biggest reboot bomb in recent memory: not only did it have the second worst Rotten Tomatoes score change &#45; behind Maleficent &#45; but it also made over $160 million less than its predecessor. When one takes in account that the last film was <i>Rise of the Silver Surfer</i>, which is maligned by nearly everyone, then it puts into perspective how bad this reboot did.</p>
      <iframe id='charts' src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1j4U5OEYfC00NVDY_3lpaAkhvTWUl3caaeB3G67RQr9Q&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='900' height='650' frameborder='0'></iframe>

<p>Again, it is not a secret that reboots make money: it feels like every month a new one has been announced. Still, it is somewhat understandable when CEO&#8217;s hit the restart button with <i>X-Men</i> or <i>Spider-Man</i>, especially when billions have already been made and spent on them. The average international gross of the 23 movies in this study was over $310 million, which is not a small chunk of change.<br><br>

However, the average Rotten Tomatoes score was 50, which is better than remakes but still not great. Furthermore, if one was to look at the worldwide box office change, 11 of the 23 films made less money than the original.  Also, time plays a big factor: those with short turnarounds, particularly the 14 movies that were rebooted within a decade, were more likely to make less than their predecessors.</p>

<p>Now, one should not jump to conclusions. The results are all over the page: one expects that the lower reviewed films would fair worse at the box office, when in reality the opposite is true. One would expect a downward trend in all reboot gains &#45; especially with the negative rhetoric all over the Internet: but for every <i>Fantastic Four</i> (2015), there is <i>Casino Royale</i> or <i>Batman Begins.</i><br><br>

When there is this security &#45; even in the failures &#45; it is understandable why studio heads would rather spend $100 million on a tested product, then try something completely new and fail &#45; I am looking at you <i>Jupiter Ascending</i>.<br><br>

Basically, this process will leave many scratching their heads, as they wonder why did Warner Brothers think another <i>Point Break</i> was a good idea? However, as long as people continue to buy tickets, studios will continue to make these decisions. Only time will tell, if the audience becomes jaded enough to stop going.</p>
